=head1 NAME

Sarze - An HTTP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

XXX

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<Sarze> is an HTTP server in Perl for L<AnyEvent>-aware applications
providing L<Promise>-based API.

The C<Sarze> module has the server class.

=head1 METHODS

There are following methods:

=over 4

=item $p = Sarze->run (...)

Run the server and return a promise that is resolved when the server
is stopped.

XXX

=item $p = Sarze->start (...)

Run the server and return a promise that is resolved with the server
object when the server is ready to accept connections.

XXX

$p = $server->stop

Schedule the server to stop and return a promise that is resolved when
the server is stopped.

XXX

$p = $server->completed

XXX
Promise must be resolved with an object that is XXX

$object->stop

XXX

This method is invoked when the worker process is to be stopped.

$promise = $object->completed

XXX

The completed promise should be resolved when the background process
has been stopped.  When the completed promise is resolved or rejected,
the entire worker process is to be stopped.

=back

=head1 OPTIONS

Following options can be specified to C<start> and C<run> methods:

=over 4

=item hostports => [[$host, $port], ...]

An array reference of zero or more host/port pair array references.  A
host/port pair must be either a pair of IP address and port (for TCP
socket) or a pair of string C<unix/> and path to the file (for UNIX
domain socket).

=item psgi_file_name

XXX

If the PSGI script file C<psgi_file_name> is not found, or does not
return a code reference, the promise returned by the C<start> or
C<run> method is to be rejected with an error.

If this option is specified, the C<eval> option must not be specified.

=item eval

XXX

If the code throws, or if the code does not define the
C<&main::psgi_app>, the promise returned by the C<start> or C<run>
method is to be rejected with an error.

If this option is specified, the C<psgi_file_name> option must not be
specified.

=item worker_background_class => $class

Specify the Perl class package name of the worker background class.
If omitted, no worker background class is used.  See L</WORKER
BACKGROUND CLASS>.

=item max_worker_count

XXX

=item connections_per_worker

XXX

=item seconds_per_worker => $seconds (default: 60*10)

After the seconds specified by this option has elapsed, a worker is
switched to the shutdowning mode, where no incoming request is
accepted anymore and any running handlers are expected to be stopped
as far as possible.

=item shutdown_timeout => $seconds (default: 60*1)

After the seconds specified by this option has elapsed from it was
switched to the shutdowning mode, a worker is uncleanly terminated
even when there is a running handler.

=back

=head1 SERVER APPLICATION

Sarze is a preforking HTTP server.  It creates worker processes which
handle coming HTTP connections.

Sarze first loads the server code, as specified by C<eval> or
C<psgi_file_name> option, and then forks that as workers.  This means
that any variable value initialized at loading is shared among the
workers executed by a server.  For example,

  ## Bad example!
  eval => q{
    my $number = rand; ## This line is executed only once.
    return sub {
      return [200, [], [$number]];
    };
  },

... always returns the same number.

=head1 WORKER BACKGROUND CLASS

When a worker process is created, the B<worker background class>, as
specified by the C<worker_background_class> option, is instantiated.

The class, if any, must be loaded as part of the server.  That is, the
code specified by the C<eval> or C<psgi_file_name> option must define
the class.

The class must have the B<C<start>> method.  It is invoked when a
worker process is created.  It must return an object, which is
referred to as B<worker background object>.  It may instead return a
promise (e.g. L<Promise>) object, which must be resolved with an
object.

The C<start> method can be used to run any per-worker initialization
steps.  The worker will not accept any connection until the method
returns an object (directly or indirectly through a promise).  The
method can also used to dispatch "background" steps running
concurrently with HTTP connection processing.

A worker background object must have a C<stop> method, which is
invoked when the worker process is expected to be terminated.  If
there is any "background" steps, it should be terminated as soon as
possible.  This method might be invoked even when there are ongoing
HTTP connections.

A worker background object must have a C<completed> method, which must
return a promise object.  The promise must not be resolved until the
worker background object is ready to be discarded.  After the promise
is resolved and all HTTP connections have been closed, the worker
process exits.  This can also be used by the worker background object
to ask the worker to not accept incoming connections anymore.

A worker background object may have a C<destory> method, which is
invoked after all HTTP connections have been closed and the
"background" steps have stopped and just before the termination of the
worker process.  This method can be used to run the shutdown steps for
the worker process.  It can return a promise object, which will delay
the termination of the worker process until the resolution.

=head1 SIGNALS

While the Sarze server is running, it receives signals.

When it receives one of C<SIGINT>, C<SIGTERM>, or C<SIGQUIT>, it stops
(as if the C<stop> method were invoked).

It might not immediately terminate the server when it is still in the
process of generating and sending a response.  Once it receives a
signal, it uninstalls the signal handler.  By sending the second
signal, which is processed by Perl's default handler, the entire
application exits and Sarze's graceful termination process is aborted.

=head1 DEPENDENCY
